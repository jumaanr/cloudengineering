# Semantic Versioning

**Semantic Versioning** (often abbreviated as **SemVer**) is a versioning system for software that helps to communicate changes in a predictable, structured way. It follows a standard convention to label versions using a three-part numbering system: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., `1.2.3`).

### Breakdown of the Version Format:
```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

1. **MAJOR version**: Increments when you make **incompatible changes** that break backward compatibility.
   - Example: `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`
   - Example Scenarios: Removing functionality, changing the API in a way that requires updates in dependent code.

2. **MINOR version**: Increments when you add **new functionality** in a backward-compatible manner.
   - Example: `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`
   - Example Scenarios: Adding new features or enhancements that do not break the existing API or functionality.

3. **PATCH version**: Increments when you make **backward-compatible bug fixes**.
   - Example: `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`
   - Example Scenarios: Bug fixes, security patches, or minor changes that do not affect the functionality.

### Rules of Semantic Versioning:
- **Initial Development (0.x.x)**: During the initial development, the version is `0.x.x`. Anything may change at any time. The `0` major version is for experimental or development stages.
- **Stable Release (1.0.0)**: Once the version reaches `1.0.0`, it signifies a stable release, and subsequent changes follow the rules of incrementing MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions.

### Semantic Versioning Example:
- `1.0.0`: Initial stable release.
- `1.1.0`: A new feature is added (backward-compatible).
- `1.1.1`: A bug fix is applied.
- `2.0.0`: An incompatible API change is made, requiring a major version increment.

### Why Use Semantic Versioning?
- **Clarity**: It clearly communicates what kind of changes have been made.
- **Predictability**: Developers can predict whether updating to a new version will break their existing implementation or not.
- **Dependency Management**: It helps when managing dependencies in a project by knowing whether it’s safe to update to a newer version of a library.
  
### Version Ranges:
Semantic versioning also makes it easier to define version ranges when depending on third-party libraries. For example, `^1.2.3` means that any version from `1.2.3` to `1.x.x` (excluding major version `2.0.0`) is acceptable, as minor and patch changes are backward-compatible.

### Conclusion:
Semantic versioning is a widely adopted convention in software development that simplifies the process of versioning software in a consistent and transparent way, reducing confusion for developers and users when upgrading software.
